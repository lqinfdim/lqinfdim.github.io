<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, there. I’m Qi Li, a CS PhD student of Tsinghua University. I also sever as research intern at HKUST-GZ. Previously, I obtained my master's degree of engineering from Tsinghua University in 2022. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in engineering from Lanzhou University.

My current research interests are efficient LLM, machine learning system for LLM, understanding deep learning (espically LLM) from both theoretical and empirical view. 
Any collaboration is welcomed, feel free to drop me an email.

<!-- My research interests include efficient large language models  and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
