<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello there! I'm Qi Li, a CS PhD student at Tsinghua University, where I also serve as a research intern at HKUST-GZ. I received my Master's degree in Engineering from Tsing University, and my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Lanzhou University (LZU).

My research interests focus on:
- Efficient algorithm for LLM: PEFT, Knowledge Editing
- Post-training for LLM
- Machine learning systems for LLM
- Understanding LLM from both theoretical and empirical perspectives

I'm open to collaboration and discussion. Feel free to reach out via email!

<!-- My research interests include efficient large language models  and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
