<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there! I'm Qi Li, a CS PhD student at Tsinghua University, where I also serve as a visiting student at HKUST-GZ. I received my Master's degree in Engineering from Tsinghua University, and my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Lanzhou University (LZU).

My current research interests focus on:
- Efficient algorithm for LLM: PEFT, Knowledge Editing
- Post-training of LLM
- Machine learning systems for LLM
- Understanding LLM from both theoretical and empirical perspectives

I'm open to collaboration and discussion. Feel free to reach out via email!
